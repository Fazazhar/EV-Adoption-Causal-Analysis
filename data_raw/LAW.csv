$2,000 to $50,000 and are determined according to the following
formulas:

* For the purchase of OEM AFVs for which the manufacturer
produces a conventionally fueled equivalent, 80% of the
incremental cost is eligible for funding.
* For the purchase of OEM AFVs for which the manufacturer does
not produce a conventionally fueled equivalent, 30% of the
overall cost of the vehicle is eligible for funding.
* For the conversion of vehicles to run on an alternative fuel,
80% of the cost of conversion is eligible for funding.
* For the purchase and installation of refueling facilities for
an alternative fuel to be used in vehicles, 50% of the facility
cost is eligible for funding.
* For the purchase and use of E85 or biodiesel in blends of 20%
or higher, 50% of the incremental cost is eligible for funding.

Project budgets may include funding from third party sources, but
the applicant itself must directly contribute at least 20% of the
project's total budget. If a grant is awarded, the applicant
will receive funds on a reimbursement basis only. Businesses,
non-profit institutions and units of local government (including
public school systems) are eligible to apply. AFV grants will

Credits for EVs and PHEVs in Category 1 are equal to the actual cost
incurred to purchase or lease the vehicle, multiplied by the battery
capacity, and divided by 100. That amount must be multiplied by a factor
to determine the credit amount, as follows: 1.0 for 2014-2018, 0.75 for
2019, 0.50 for 2020, and 0.25 for 2021.

Annual credit caps exist for each technology type and vehicle weight
class, and for cumulative annual credits. A person who claimed a tax
credit in previous years for the purchase or lease of Model Year 2004
and newer HEV may claim an additional credit for the conversion of the
same vehicle to a PHEV. The purchase of a used vehicle may qualify if
the vehicle was not previously registered in Colorado. Credits may not
be carried forward and a taxpayer will receive a refund for the excess
credit.

Credits for vehicles purchased, leased, or converted during the 2014 tax
year may be determined in one of two different ways. For more

Rhode Island, and Vermont in signing a memorandum of understanding (MOU)
to support the deployment of ZEVs through involvement in a ZEV Program
Implementation Task Force (Task Force). By April 2014, the Task Force
will develop a plan of action to accomplish the goals of the MOU,
including deploying at least 3.3 million ZEVs and adequate fueling
infrastructure within the signatory states by 2025. On an annual basis,
each state must report on the number of registered ZEVs, the number of
public electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) and hydrogen fueling
stations, and available information regarding workplace fueling for
ZEVs. Each state also commits to:

-   Support ZEV commercialization through consistent statewide building
    codes and standards for installing EVSE, streamlined metering
    options for homes equipped with EVSE, opportunities to reduce
    vehicle operating costs, increased electric system efficiency
    through time-of-use electricity rates and net metering for electric
    vehicles, and integrating ZEVs with renewable energy initiatives;
-   Establish ZEV purchase targets for governmental agency fleets,
    explore opportunities for coordinated vehicle and fueling station
    equipment procurement, work to provide public access to government
    fleet fueling stations, and include commitments to use ZEVs in state
    contracts with auto dealers and car rental companies where
    appropriate;
-   Evaluate the need for, and effectiveness of, monetary incentives to
    reduce the upfront purchase price of ZEVs as well as non-monetary
    incentives, such as high occupancy vehicle lane access, reduced
    tolls, and preferential parking, and pursue these incentives as
    appropriate;
-   Work to develop uniform standards to promote ZEV consumer acceptance
    and awareness, industry compliance, and economies of scale,
    including adopting universal signage, common methods of payment and
    interoperability of EVSE networks, and reciprocity among states for
    non-monetary ZEV incentives;
-   Cooperate with vehicle manufacturers, electricity and hydrogen
    providers, the fueling infrastructure industry, corporate fleet
    owners, financial institutions, and others to encourage ZEV market
    growth;
-   Share research and develop a coordinated education and outreach
    campaign to highlight the benefits of ZEVs, including collaboration
    with related national and regional initiatives; and
-   Assess and develop potential deployment strategies and
    infrastructure requirements for the commercialization of hydrogen
    fuel cell vehicles.

(Plan), which establishes targets to improve freight efficiency and
transition to zero emission technologies. The Plan identifies state
policies, programs, and investments to achieve the following targets:

-   Improve freight system efficiency by 25% by 2030; and
-   Deploy over 100,000 zero emission freight vehicles and associated
    equipment, maximizing the number of vehicles powered by renewable
    energy, by 2030.

The involved parties have also initiated corridor-level freight pilot
projects to integrate advanced technologies, alternative fuels, freight
and fuel infrastructure, and local economic development opportunities
based on the Plan. For more information, see the [Transportation

Department of Public Health and Environment, and Department of Personnel
and Administration (DPA) will establish a State Fleet Sub-Council
(Sub-Council) to help develop, implement, and improve programs, plans,
and policies that save money, reduce emissions, promote domestic fuel
use, and conserve natural resources. The Sub-Council will:

-   Develop standard procedures and formulas for modeling and monitoring
    potential alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) and fuel reduction
    efforts that link acquisition and operations budgets;
-   Create an idle reduction policy for state agencies;
-   Create a process that allows fleet coordinators to replace vehicles
    with AFVs before standard retirement age if the replacement is
    cost-effective;
-   Identify and evaluate other fuel-saving practices and develop
    procedures for their implementation; and
-   Evaluate alternative financing options for state fleet vehicles
    including leasing, energy performance contracting, and other options
    that may reduce costs.

In addition, DPA and CDOT will establish policies and procedures to
promote the cost-effective use of non-petroleum fuel vehicles and other
fleet efficiency improvements. The policies must strive for the use of
non-petroleum based fuels at least 90% of the time when cost-effective.
